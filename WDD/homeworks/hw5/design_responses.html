                            <p> Using transitions can be a great way to make your design more exciting. Animations are interesting, but if an animation is too long it can become frustrating navigating the space. Scaling the size of elements and moving them around is a cool way to change the focus of a page. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> As always, seeing a diverse range of designs is always inspiring and exciting. Even though I consider myself to be someone who really appreciates design, I don't often sit on a page and admire how design elements adjust to user interaction. Viewing dynamic elements with the <em>intent</em> of admiring the design makes it easier to really appreciate the work that went into some of the decisions. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> It's hard to pick, but <a href="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*DEAx4DesvhiBRCDfvpza_g.gif">"Welcome screen / login"</a> by <a href="https://dribbble.com/aradisic">Andrej Radisic</a> may be my favorite. The design is simple, using variations of white and dark grey for almost everything (with an accent of blue in the video for just a splash of colored-intrigue). The transition is less than a second, and has a very interesting texture that almost burns its way up the page, like some kind of strange magnetic alloy. The landing page is very minimal, with no distractions from the intention: read a quick description of the app and then login or sign up. On the landing page, the background is an off-white and the platform logo is a dark grey, and on the login page these colors swap in a way that seems to indicate that you're in a non-content page, while still being very cohesive with the rest of the design.</p>

                            <p> 9 / 10 </p>
                            <p> This collection of designs by different artists/designers is a great resource. It's also awesome having a quick way to see other works that each artist has done. As someone new to learning design, it could be nice to see a brief writeup (maybe just a sentence or two) about why each design was chosen for thise collection; this is why I dropped the score to a 9. </p>
