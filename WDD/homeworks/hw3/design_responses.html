							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Font choice is about considering your purpose, audience, and greater design. 
								Font includes the typeface, size, and decoration (which includes things like <strong>bolding</strong>, <em>italics</em>, and <u>underline</u>).
								The intended purpose of a font— the original design motivations— can be evaluated in order to better understand how a particular font may suit the needs of your design. 
								<br>Aligning your font choice with the rest of your design decisions is crucial to making a cohesive project. </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>

								In addition to the different font examples embedded directly in the article, there are a number of links to resources with freely available fonts. 
								It's exciting knowing that I have access to so many different typeface options, all for free! </p>
