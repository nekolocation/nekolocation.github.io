					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> Wireframe for the <a href="https://justbasic.com/index.html">JustBASIC home page</a>: </p>
							<p><a href="https://justbasic.com/index.html"><img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/My wireframe.jpg"/></a></p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> Redesigned wireframe for the <a href="https://justbasic.com/index.html">JustBASIC home page</a>: </p>
							<p><a href="https://justbasic.com/index.html"><img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/My wireframe redesign.jpg"/></a></p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p>The JustBASIC website is aimed towards people who want to learn or teach programming at a fairly simplified level. The website is simple and approachable, and has minimal information in order to get to the point.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p>The web page for JustBASIC is purposefully designed to be simple and approachable, but can come off as uninteresting and boring for modern sensibilities; a modern website with so few elements can afford to make each element larger. Since the home page has a lot of empty space, the places that <em>do</em> have information can feel a bit cluttered (possibly an artefact from when pixel resolutions were smaller in the 90s, when JustBASIC was released). 
							My redesign keeps things simple while making adjustments to the layout to make the page feel less cluttered and more interestingâ€” as well as adding a dedicated DOWNLOAD button to the corner, which I think a website focusing on a single product should have. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
