				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> While I was previously familiar with many of the unethical practices described in the article, I now have names to attach to them, along with a better understanding of how these tactics are used. Before reading this article, I perceived dark patterns as a tactic used by unsavory or suspicious websites. Now I view these tactics as strategies used by all kinds of businesses, including those widely lauded by their consumer-base and the public. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was the section discussing the political impact of misleading design, particularly during the 2016 election. While I was aware of the targeted disinformation surrounding this event, I had never thought of the issue in terms of design decisions. My perspective has shifted since reading the article, and I'm now more curious about the impact of such design choices-- especially how they extend past the individual user. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "I believe that as user experience designers we need to think beyond providing aesthetics and usability to our users. We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society behave." </p>
					</li>
