							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> With regards to animation duration, the size of the screen can be crucial to the length of the animation. A smaller screen only needs a short time for objects to move a certain distance, while larger screens necessitate longer times for the same proportional distance. Other things to take into account are the size of the object(s) being transformed, and the overall complexity of the animation. There are many considerations to take into account with the transformation of objects, but it's ultimately about how you want to direct the user's eye, how to create the most natural-looking movement, and how to give the user the tools to anticipate the new state of the design. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> As always, the cool visuals (in this case, animations) are really fun. They make me feel like I understand the concepts way better. A lot of these animation concepts were surprisingly unintuitive to me; that is, it makes sense upon reading, but I could see myself doing lots of things this article says not to do. Seeing live demonstrations makes everything click better for me, and helps me to understand why certain design decisions are less savvy than others.</p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "According to <a href="https://material.io/design/motion/customization.html#speed">Material Design Guidelines</a>, it is better to use an asymmetric curve to make the movement look more natural and realistic. The end of the curve must be more emphasized than its beginning, so that the duration of acceleration is shorter than that of slowing down. In this case, the user will pay more attention to the final movement of the element and thus to its new state." </p>
