							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Shape, form, movement, position, value, and space (as well as the other principles of art) are crucial to the readability and efficiency of design. These elements convey information, sometimes subconsciously, to the user. This information can help the user engage with the website in effective and meaningful ways. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The use of visual examples was very helpful in understanding the application and practicality of these insights. Without these demonstrations, I know I'd be left thinking "so what?" However, the simple mock-examples give me a good feel for how to apply the principles taught in the article. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "[...] items that are related should stay close to each other, while the unrelated items should stay further apart. White space plays a vital role here as it creates contrast guiding the usersâ€™ eyes in the intended direction. White space can boost visual hierarchy and information flow, contributing in easy to read and scan layouts. It will help users achieve their goals faster and delve deeper into the content." </p>
