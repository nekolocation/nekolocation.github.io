							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Guidelines exist for color accessibility; for example, a 4.5:1 background-to-text contrast ratio is best practice for design elements. As well, it's bad practice for color alone to be an indicatorâ€” a red outline, for example, will only successfully convey information to those who can see the color. To solve these kinds of problems, textures, shapes, and symbols can be paired with colors (perhaps as a toggled option) to enable more usability to colorblind users. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The integration of example images was very helpful for me to understand why certain things were problems. The best case of this was when the article discussed error states: seeing the example with the circled exclamation point contrasted with the example without it immediately showed me both what the problem was and a way to fix it. As well, in the case of the background-to-text contrast ratio, the "4.5:1" suggestion didn't mean much to me, but seeing it in action made it more clear to me what the numbers meant and how to keep my own eyes open for such a problem. </p>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Apart from accessibility being an ethical best practice, there are also potential legal implications for not complying with regulatory requirements around accessibility. In 2017, plaintiffs filed at least <a href="https://www.adatitleiii.com/2018/01/2017-website-accessibility-lawsuit-recap-a-tough-year-for-businesses/">814 federal lawsuits</a> about allegedly inaccessible websites, including a number of class actions." </p>
