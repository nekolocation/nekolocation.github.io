    <p><strong>Hi, I'm Edward!</strong> I'm a laid-back guy who enjoys gaming, watching shows with my wife, making art (and comics), cooking and baking (sometimes), and serving my friends.
    I'm excited to be at UC Berkeley, because it means I'm free from all the Physics and Calculus classes at community college! (Though I'd rather retake Multivariable Calculus than grind out CS70 lol)
    <br/>I look forward to learning design principles and adding fun, cool skills to my toolkit through this class!</p>

    <p>I haven't been here for very long, but here are my favorite places to eat so far:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://alleykitchens.com/">Alley Kitchens</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.shengkee.com/">Sheng Kee Bakery</a> </li>

    <p><strong><em>Cool website: </em></strong>
        My housemate recently showed me this really cool website called <a href="https://minitokyo3d.com/">Mini Tokyo 3D</a>. 
        The website gives a real-time mapping of public transport across Tokyo (including airplanes)!
        You can also see what the weather is like, whether firework shows are happening, and view camera streams from different parts of the city.</p>

    <p><strong><em><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-develop-an-eye-for-design-c5a4c64bb26c?gi=dca4e77aef0d">Article</a> thoughts:</em></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><em><u>Something I learned from the article</u></em> 
            — By reading this article, I learned that deconstruction is a helpful way to analyze design (especially for an app or website). 
            Deconstructing a design lets you engage more critically with individual components and how those components build off of one another.</li>
        <li><em><u>Favorite part of the article</u></em> 
            — My favorite part of the article was the integration of animated deconstruction (or perhaps <em>re</em>construction) gifs. 
            It's really interesting to see familiar interfaces stripped down and isolated, and it made me think more carefully about the individual design decisions that go into building a virtual interface.</li>
        <li><em><u>Thought-provoking quote</u></em>: <br/>
            "I was obsessed with copying pieces of the trending Dribbble shots, but oblivious to how all the pieces worked together. 
            If you could see the harsh drop shadows and unnecessary flourish I added to things, you would gasp in horror."</li>
        <li><em><u>Article score</u></em> — 8/10 (Great length, thoughtful, interesting, and to the point!)</li>
    </ul>
