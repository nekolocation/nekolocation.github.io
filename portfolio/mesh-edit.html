		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this project, we have implemented functions and algorithms for geometric modeling.  In the first section, we implemented de Casteljau’s algorithm for evaluating Bezier curves and surfaces. In the second section, we used the half-edge data structure to process meshes, involving faces, edges, and vertices. We learned how to apply mesh manipulation techniques such as edge flips and edge splits, eventually implementing loop subdivision to upsample meshes. It was interesting having to carefully manage many different pointers to make sure we preserved the half-edge topology.

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		De Casteljiau’s algorithm evaluates Bezier curves by recursively doing linear interpolation between the control points. We implemented it by calculating n - 1 intermediate points (with n being the number of control points), and recursively applying the lerp equation (1−t)pi​+tpi+1 on pairs of points using the scalar parameter t. 
		<br/><br/>
		The following figure demonstrates our implementation:
		<br/><br/>
		<figure>

		</figure>
		<br/><br/>
		By repeatedly evaluating the linear interpolation points, we can produce points that lie upon the Bezier curve:

		As the control points and the parameter t change, so does the Bezier curve:
		<br/><br/>

		</figure>
		<br/><br/>
		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		De Casteljau’s algorithm can be extended to Bezier surfaces by applying the algorithm iteratively along two dimensions instead of just one. The function evaluateStep() does a linear interpolation on a vector of points, and in evaluate1D() we call evaluateStep multiple times to result in a single point from a set of points of a Bezier curve. The evaluate function finally uses evaluate1D() to each row of controlPoint using parameter u, and then applies evaluate1D() on the resulting set of points using parameter v, which results in our final point of the Bezier surface. 
		<br/><br/>
		With this implementation, we were able to render .bez files, demonstrated below:

		<br/><br/>
		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		We implemented area-weighted vertex normals by iterating through all the incident faces to our vertex. We compute the normal for each face by taking the cross product (using cross()) of its two edge vectors, which also weighs its normal by the face area. We then normalized the sum of all the area-weighted normals using the unit() function. 
		<br/><br/>
		We can see a render of the teapot below which uses shading without vertex normals:
		<br/><br/>

		</figure>
		<br/><br/>
		In comparison, the following image uses Phong shading:
		<br/><br/>

		</figure>
		<br/><br/>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		To implement the edge flip operation, we followed the logic demonstrated in the graphic below:
		<br/><br/>
		<figure>
			<img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part4-flip-diagram.png" width="400px"/>
		</figure>
		<br/><br/>
		We start by ensuring that we’re not operating on a boundary, then we create pointers to all the objects that will be updated in the flipping process. These include the edge we are going to flip and its two half-edges, the adjacent faces to the edge, the outer half-edges (whose next() attributes will need adjusting),  and all the vertices. Finally, we use these pointers to reassign neighbors such that the edge from b to c now goes from a to d, and all vertices, edges, and faces in the triangle are consistent with this update. 
		<br/><br/>
		After implementing this logic, we can successfully flip edges within our mesh:
		<br/><br/>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part4-before.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Mesh Before Flipping</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part4-after.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Mesh After Flipping</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		Most of the debugging process for this implementation involved dealing with the multitude of variables involved in the triangles. We had many variables named similarly, like ‘hbtoc’ and ‘hctob’ for half-edges (in this naming scheme, hbtoc is the half-edge from vertex b to vertex c), and there were many instances of accidentally using the incorrect variable, which caused errors. Another thing that caused us issues was failing to update all the necessary variables for each object in the triangles (namely the vertices’ half-edge pointers were not adjusted, which caused problems that were not discovered until later on). 
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>

		To demonstrate our implementation of splitting edges, take the following diagram as an example:
		<br/><br/>
		<figure>
			<img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part5-split-diagram.jpg" width="400px"/>
		</figure>
		<br/><br/>
		To begin, we take an edge, BC, whose endpoints are the vertices of B and C and which lies between the two triangles ABC and BCD. Our goal is to split both ABC and BCD in half such that we have four triangles within the given space instead of two. To accomplish this, we first verify that the edge is not a boundary edge, then create a new midpoint vertex, M, whose position lies between B and C: \(frac{c->position + b->position}{2}\). We then have to define four edges, which connect M to every other vertex. We also must define four faces for each quadrant of the new structure. For each of the four inner edges, we must also define two directed half-edges. In defining these new elements, we first reassign the old elements, to only create as many new objects in memory as we necessarily need. 
		<br/><br/>
		We update the object pointers of all of these new variables, to link every element together so that the mesh object understands their relationship. Finally, we update the information held by each element, guaranteeing that every vertex and face points to an appropriately connected half-edge, and each edge points to one of its half edges. Further, each half edge must point to: 
		<ul>
			<li>the next half edge in the triangle (maintaining a counter-clockwise orientation within each triangle) </li>
			<li>its twin half-edge (eg: AM->twin() == MA)</li>
			<li>origin vertex (eg: AM->vertex() == A && MA->vertex() == M)</li>
			<li>edge (AM and MA should point to the same edge object)</li>
			<li>and face (eg: MA->face() should point to the lower left face while AM->face() should point to the upper left face)</li>
		</ul>
		<br/><br/>
		We are then able to split edges along a mesh:
		<br/><br/>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part5-before-splits.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Base Mesh</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part5-after-splits.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Mesh with Splits</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		We can also combine flip and split operations:
		<br/><br/>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				  <figcaption>Base Mesh</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part5-after-splits-and-flips.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Mesh with Combined Flips and Splits</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		We found the difficulty of this problem to be more conceptual than technical, so debugging involved drawing out a sketch to map out all of the changes between the two triangles, to make sure all the necessary variables were updated. We avoided repeating some issues encountered in the edge-flip implementation by using setNeighbors() to update all relevant member variables within the triangle simultaneously. Another change we made was declaring a new pointer to the original edge iterator when changing its connections, so that the nature of its new role in the mesh could be more easily understood by its new variable name (ie: The half edge ‘hbtoc’ was updated to be called ‘hbtom’). These steps helped avoid confusion and missing steps when updating the neighbors of vertices, edges, half-edges, and faces.
		<br/><br/>
		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		We implemented loop subdivision by first computing the new positions for all the vertices of the original mesh, and getting the new positions for all the midpoints that would be inserted on each edge. These positions were stored in Vertex::newPosition and Edge::newPosition so that we don’t change the original mesh. We then split every original edge to make the new midpoint vertices, and flipped all the new edges that connected a new to an old vertex. All the vertices’ positions are then updated to their new values. 
		<br/><br/>
		With this implementation, we can subdivide our meshes: 
		<br/><br/>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part6-cow-loop1.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Base Mesh</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part6-cow-loop2.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Mesh Upsampled Once</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td colspan="2" style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part6-cow-loop3.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Mesh Upsampled Twice</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		After loop subdivision, sharp corners and edges become more rounded as the surface of the mesh becomes smooth. By pre-splitting some edges, we can reduce this rounding since we create more control points that reduce the impact of the loop subdivision’s smoothing. Below you can see that we presplit some edges at the tip of the cow’s ear. As we do some loop subdivision, we can observe that because of the presplitting, its flatter shape is more preserved after loop subdivision: 
		<br/><br/>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part6-cow-presplit1.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Base Mesh</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part6-cow-presplit2.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Mesh Upsampled Once</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td colspan="2" style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part6-cow-presplit3.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Mesh Upsampled Twice</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		Some mesh shapes may experience unintended effects when upsampling, like this cube which becomes asymmetric with subdivisions:
		<br/><br/>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part6-cube-loop1.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Base Mesh</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="./assets/img/meshedit/part6-cube-loop2-rough.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Mesh Upsampled Once</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td colspan="2" style="text-align: center;">

				  <figcaption>Mesh Upsampled Twice</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		We can ensure that the cube subdivides symmetrically by splitting edges such that each of the 6 faces of the cube has the same number of edges and vertices (each face has four edges and a vertex in the middle). By pre-processing, we can remove asymmetry and ensure there is uniformity among all the faces, resulting in symmetry after several loop subdivisions on the cube:
		<br/><br/>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
